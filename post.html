<center><h1>Post Operative Care For Fractures:</h1></center>
<h3>
*Post operative care is as important as  surgical treatment for fractures.<br>
*Broken bones takes around 2-3 months to heal(to form a temporary bone). This temporary bone is not as strong as real bone and slowly gets replaced by 
strong bone which takes another 2-3 months. <br>
*If proper care and attention are not payed most possible complications which can occur are:<br>
1.Poor alignment of bone.<br>
2.Infection.<br>
3.Improper practice of rehabilitation techniques, improper usage of crutches further worsen the condition and leads to mal-union.<br>
4.Improper monitoring of skin under cast will make the skin itchy and senstive to infection.<br>
5.Lack of regular inspection can cause swelling, blueness or loss of movement of fingers/toes, numbness or increased pain.<br>
6.As Fractured area is immobilized for a period of 3-4 months, surroundings muscles becomes weak, if proper care is not given rehabilitation becomes difficult.
